Info:

&nbsp;

it will then show what binary code it suits.
&nbsp;

like 0100 0001 = A, 0100 0010 = B and 0100 0011 = C.
when mouse over title you can see by what it cycles to.

&nbsp;

the third one is sexagesimal with hours and minutes.
and the last one is sexagesimal with hours, minutes and seconds.

&nbsp;

-Cook Timer

you can have 3 timers running on the same time. every timer can have it's own name, hours and minutes to count from.
when you stop a timer it will be reset to 0:00. and no it can not be paused. but you can change the time and start from there.
when an alarm bel sounds it will take 1 minute to go off by itself. when alarm is on. it will be stopped when you unload the skin.
it sounds like normal, but it is not. 
when you locked your computer the timers just keep working. so alarm bel rings. and time keeps counting.
the changes you make in the skin are saved and used when reloaded. first of all when change settings while there is an alarm counting all alarms are going to stop.
and be set to 0:00.
a problem is when you use your screen as speakers. and the screen do go in standby you will not hear a thing.
when having external speakers it will keep working until the computer do go in standby.
the skin do not keep the computer in wake state. and that is how it should work.

i think it is fun to have a skin like this. but i still recommend an old timer with no battery's needed.
if you want to have a timer with seconds. then yes it is better to buy a digital timer on battery's.
